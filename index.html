      <p>
        Something in the way she moves Attracts me like no other lover Something
        in the way she woos me I don't want to leave her now You know I believe
        and how
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere in her smile she knows That I don't need no other lover
        Something in her style that shows me I don't want to leave her now You
        know I believe and how
      </p>
      <p>
        You're asking me will my love grow I don't know, I don't know You stick
        around, now it may show I don't know, I don't know
      </p>
      <p>
        Something in the way she knows And all I have to do is think of her
        Something in the things she shows me I don't want to leave her now You
        know I believe and how
      </p>
